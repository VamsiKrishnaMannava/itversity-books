    "### *Errors*\n",
    "Syntax errors, also known as parsing errors, are perhaps the most common kind of complaint you get while you are still learning Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "eg: <mark>while True print('Hello world')</mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Exceptions*\n",
    "Even if a statement or expression is syntactically correct, it may cause an error when an attempt is made to execute it. Errors detected during execution are called *exceptions* and are not unconditionally fatal: you will soon learn how to handle them in Python programs. Most exceptions are not handled by programs, however, and result in error messages as shown here:\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Handling Exceptions (try/catch)*\n",
    "It is possible to write programs that handle selected exceptions. Look at the following example, which asks the user for input until a valid integer has been entered, but allows the user to interrupt the program (using <mark>Control-C</mark> or whatever the operating system supports); note that a user-generated interruption is signalled by raising the <mark>KeyboardInterrupt</mark> exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Flow of try/catch execution*\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, the try clause (the statement(s) between the <mark>try</mark> and <mark>except<mark> keywords) is executed.\n",
    "* If no exception occurs, the except clause is skipped and execution of the <mark>try</mark> statement is finished.\n",
    "* If an exception occurs during execution of the try clause, the rest of the clause is skipped. Then if its type matches the exception named after the <mark>except</mark> keyword, the except clause is executed, and then execution continues after the <mark>try</mark> statement.\n",
    "* If an exception occurs which does not match the exception named in the except clause, it is passed on to outer <mark>try</mark> statements; if no handler is found, it is an unhandled exception and execution stops with a message as shown above.\n",
    "* A <mark>try</mark> statement may have more than one except clause, to specify handlers for different exceptions\n",
    "* An except clause may name multiple exceptions as a parenthesized tuple as shown above\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Raising Exceptions*\n",
    "The <mark>raise</mark> statement allows the programmer to force a specified exception to occur. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "<mark>aise NameError('HiThere')</mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Cleanup Actions*\n",
    "The <mark>try</mark> statement has another optional clause which is intended to define clean-up actions that must be executed under all circumstances\n",
    "* A finally clause is always executed before leaving the <mark>try</mark> statement, whether an exception has occurred or not.\n",
    "* When an exception has occurred in the <mark>try</mark> clause and has not been handled by an <mark>except</mark> clause (or it has occurred in an <mark>except</mark> or <mark>else</mark> clause), it is re-raised after the <mark>finally</mark> clause has been executed.\n",
    "* The <mark>finally</mark> clause is also executed “on the way out” when any other clause of the <mark>try</mark> statement is left via a <mark>break</mark>, <mark>continue</mark> or <mark>return</mark> statement."
