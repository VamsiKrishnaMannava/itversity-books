    "```cat > <filename> ex: cat > test2```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also redirect the standard output of a file into a new file or an existing file with **‘>’**. For an existing file the contents of the file will be overridden. We can even append the contents of a file to the end an existing file using **‘>>’**. Another way to create a file is using **vi** or **nano**. To see the contents of files we can use cat command. We can also use editors such as vi or nano to see the contents of the file and update the file. There is a command called view to open the file in read-only mode. To troubleshoot the issues, it is recommended to open the file using view command.\n",
