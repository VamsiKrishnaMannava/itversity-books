    "## **Overview of SSH Software**\n",
    "\n",
    "* SSH is primarily used to connect to servers remotely from any where. Let us get the high level overview of SSH.\n",
    "* SSH is not only used for login but also to copy files using commands or tools like scp, rsync etc.\n",
    "* We can use the command like <mark>ssh username@hostname</mark> to connect to remote servers.\n",
    "* To connect to remote server using SSH, sshd should be installed on the remote server.\n",
    "* Typically sshd will be setup, if in case it is not then the root user can login via console directly and install using tools like yum (Centos) or apt-get (Ubuntu)\n",
    "* Once ssh is setup, we need to ensure that it is up and running all the time. We need to start the service and enable as part of startup scripts.\n",
    "* If sshd is down, then we cannot connect to that remote server using ssh command. However some of the cloud platforms provide console access via plugins. We need to use it to fix the issue and start the service.\n",
    "* A sudoer can check the status of the process using commands like <mark>ps -ef|grep sshd</mark> or <mark>systemctl status sshd</mark>\n",
    "* Any process in linux is typically associated with port number. For ssh, it is by default 22.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can either connect to the remote server using a password or using keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Configuring SSH**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us understand how one can customize the behavior of SSH.\n",
    "* In Linux, properties files are typically copied under <mark>/etc</mark> by default, for sshd it is <mark>/etc/ssh</mark>.\n",
    "* Actual properties file is <mark>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</mark>\n",
    "* sshd will be started on reboots as we typically add it to startup scripts using commands like <mark>systemctl enable sshd</mark>.\n",
    "* You must be a root user or sudoer to access the above commands.\n",
    "* From the client, we run ssh command to connect to this server (eg: ssh username@remoteserver)\n",
    "* Some of the important properties\n",
    "    * Port – port on which sshd should be running (default 22)\n",
    "    * ListenAddress – IP Binding (default 0.0.0.0). A server can have multiple ip addresses, if we want people to connect from clients to that server only with one of those ip addresses bound to the server, then we override with actual ip address (eg: letting people connect using private ip)\n",
    "    * PermitRootLogin – To enable or disable connecting to the server as root via ssh from clients of the server.\n",
    "    * PasswordAuthentication – To enable or disable connecting to the server using passwords. If disabled then admins have to use copy public key of the user who want to connect to the server. There are tools which can take care of these automatically.\n",
    "* If you change the properties of this sshd_config directory you must restart the service to update the changes. You can restart the service using <mark>systemctl restart sshd</mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can change the PermitRootLogin in the above file to avoid access to the root login.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Setup Passwordless login**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us understand how we can log in to remote servers without using Passwords. It is called as Passwordless login and is more secure than logging in using Passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You need to generate ssh keys (private and a public key) on your PC and copy contents of public key to the remote server to authorized_keys for the user using which you are trying to connect to remote server.\n",
    "* If you are using Mac or Linux, once you launch terminal you will be in the user’s home directory.\n",
    "* We can generate ssh keys using <mark>ssh-keygen</mark>\n",
    "* A private key should be on your PC and public key should be copied to the remote server (authorized_keys of the user using which you try to connect)\n",
    "* If you don’t give any names when it prompts for it, It will use id_rsa for private key and id_rsa.pub for the public key and the location would be your home directory.\n",
    "* Ensure that the directory under which we have these keys and keys them selves have no permissions for group or others (700 for directories and 600 for files)\n",
    "* ~ is the representation of your home directory in Unix flavors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Troubleshooting Connectivity Issues**\n",
    "\n",
    "At times, we might not be able to connect to remote servers using SSH. If that is the case, let us understand how to troubleshoot the issues with respect to logging in using SSH.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **telnet**\n",
    "Telnet is a protocol used for interactive communication with another host using the TELNET protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use #telnet to see the status of telnet and if it is working if will enter into a shell telnet>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **ping**\n",
    "If the ping is enabled in your server you can check the connectivity between your server and the remote server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage:#ping\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check if the ping is working properly using ping ip address port number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Firewall**\n",
    "A firewall is a system that provides network security by filtering incoming and outgoing network traffic. Firewalls provide an essential layer of security that, combined with other measures, prevent attackers from accessing your servers in malicious ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Understanding the Console**\n",
    "Servers are typically remote to our work location. If there is some issue on the server and if sshd process does not start then we will not be able to connect using SSH. However, to resolve the issue we might have to connect to console directly.\n",
    "* For every server, we have an IPMI where we can connect through web UI rather than SSH.\n",
    "* But in AWS we don’t have connected through the console and if we have errors we need to contact support.\n",
    "* We can connect to the console without using SSH if it is supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Profile**\n",
    "When you use ssh or console to connect via terminal, it will behave in a particular way. It is called Profile. Let us understand a few details with respect to User Profiles which will control the behavior of the environment.\n",
    "* Whenever you log in to a remote machine there will be a predefined behavior such as username, private IP, and path with we are currently.\n",
    "* If we change the path, the updated path will be shown in the profile. This is all called runtime behavior and this is all based on the profile which is generated when the user is created.\n",
    "* To know the profile In Linux bash, ksh or csh. You can use <mark>which shell</mark> command to understand which shell you are running\n",
    "\n",
    ".bash_profile will control the environment of this user. You can look at this bash profile using cat .bash_profile\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Managing Users**\n",
    "Let us see how we can manage different user accounts created on the servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the enterprise level, System Administrator will take care of the permissions for the user depending upon the resource level. The administrator will give the permissions such as read write and execute for every user.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add a user to the groups and you can add the password to the user by adding -p as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage: #useradd username -p\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Managing Groups**\n",
    "Users can be grouped and we can control the permissions at group level. Let us understand how we can manage groups in Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "The group is a logical consolidation of relevant users such as developers, system admins, and operations. Whenever you add a new user you will be assigning the candidate depending upon the group. You can use below example to create new groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage: #groupadd groupname\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add new users to the groups or we can modify the existing users by using below command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage: #usermod\n",
    "\n",
    "### ***Overview of root and sudoers***\n",
    "root is super user in Linux. root have all the access on the server. Let us understand more about root and how other accounts can act as root.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Linux, There are two types of users such as Root user or superuser and the normal user. A wheel is a group which has sudo permissions by default in RedHat flavor. You can add a normal user using #user add with a password using # passwd\n",
    "\n",
    "username then run #visudo and edit the /etc/sudoers file. You can see the wheel group in this file and whoever is added to this wheel group can use the sudoer permission on this server. You can add the users using the below commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "usage: # usermod -a -G wheel username\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Installing Software using yum**\n",
    "Let us understand how softwares can be downloaded and installed automatically using yum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yum is the package manager available in the RedHat flavors which helps users to install, remove and manage the packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage:#yum install  httpd"
